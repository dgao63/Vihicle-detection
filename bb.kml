	<description><![CDATA[<div style=''><div><div><p><span>This is a digital Seismic Hazard Zone Map presenting areas where liquefaction and landslides may occur during a strong earthquake. Three types of geological hazards, referred to as seismic hazard zones, may be featured on the map: 1) liquefaction, 2) earthquake-induced landslides, and 3) overlapping liquefaction and earthquake-induced landslides. In addition, a fourth feature may be included representing areas not evaluated for liquefaction or earthquake-induced landslides. Developers of properties falling within any of the three zones may be required to investigate the potential hazard and mitigate its threat during the local permitting process.</span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>
